## Welcome to KegLevel Monitor ##

KegLevel Monitor monitors the level of beer in your kegs. It provides flow sensors and temperature sensors to provide real-time data on the status of your kegerator.

[SECTION: keg_settings]
## Keg Settings ##

This screen allows you to define the physical characteristics of your kegs to calculate volume accurately.

**Definitions:**
* **Tare Weight:** The weight of the keg shell when completely empty.
* **Starting Total Weight:** The weight of the full keg (shell + liquid).
* **Maximum Full Volume:** The theoretical capacity (e.g., 18.93L for a Corny keg). Used for graphical displays.
* **Calculated Starting Volume:** Derived automatically from the weights above. This is your true "100%" reference for tracking.

**How to use:**
1. Click **Add New Keg** to create a profile.
2. Enter the weights in your preferred unit (kg or lb).
3. Click **Save**.
4. Assign this profile to a specific Tap in the main window dropdowns.

[SECTION: beverage_library]
## Beverage Library ##

The Library stores details about the beers, ciders, or seltzers you have on tap.

**Features:**
* **Importing:** You can import standard BJCP style guidelines using the dropdown at the bottom of the main library list.
* **Editing:** Click "Edit" on any item to customize ABV, IBU, or descriptions.
* **Assignment:** Once a beverage is created here, you can assign it to a Tap on the main screen using the dropdowns above the progress bars.

[SECTION: notifications]
## Notification Settings ##

KegLevel can alert you via email when kegs get low or temperature goes out of range.

**Outbound Alerts (Push):**
Set up a recipient email to receive daily or hourly status reports containing flow data and temperature logs.

**Conditional Alerts:**
* **Volume:** Trigger an instant email when a keg drops below a specific volume (e.g., 4 Liters).
* **Temperature:** Trigger an alert if the kegerator gets too warm (e.g., > 45F) or too cold (e.g., < 30F).

**Inbound Control:**
Enable "Status Request" to allow the system to check for emails with the subject "STATUS". It will reply immediately with current system stats.

[SECTION: calibration]
## Flow Sensor Calibration ##

To ensure accurate tracking, each flow meter must be calibrated to your specific system pressure and line length.

**The "Pour Calibration" Method:**
1. Click **Calibrate** next to a specific tap.
2. Pour a known volume (e.g., exactly 1 Liter or 32oz) into a measuring jug.
3. Enter that known volume into the "Volume Poured" box.
4. Click **Stop**. The system will calculate the new "Pulses Per Liter" (K-Factor) automatically.
5. (Optional) You can choose to deduct this calibration pour from your inventory or ignore it.

**The "Keg Calibration" Method:**
1. placeholder

**Expert Mode:**
If you already know your K-Factor, click "Manual Cal Factor - Expert Only" on the main calibration screen to type it in directly.

Global configuration for the application.

* **Display Mode:** Toggle between "Full" (1080p) and "Compact" (800x600) layouts.
* **Units:** Switch between Metric (Liters/Kg/C) and Imperial (Gallons/Lb/F).
* **Pour Volume:** Define the size of a standard pour (e.g., 12oz or 500ml) for the "Pours Remaining" display.
* **Autostart:** Configure the Raspberry Pi to launch KegLevel automatically on boot.
